## Development Priorities

1. Deploy contracts on a test net and decide on where to fetch the ABI from. `easy to delegate`
2. Finish code for interfacing with a "standard" compliant contract and display all the raw data needed for visualizations.
3. Finish the code for all user actions, i.e. bid, withdraw, etc.
4. Use raw data to create nice data visualizations using WebGL, D3, etc; previews; and summaries. `easy to delegate`
